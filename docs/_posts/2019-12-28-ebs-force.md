Now we'll use EBS to estimate how long our shopping tour will take. This is what is going to happen:

1. Read all the ratios of finished tasks: Fill ratio pool.
1. Run Monte-Carlo simulation on task queue
1. Get a pair of (propability\|time) which tells you how certain you are finishing a task with the given amount of time.

### Ratio pool fill

Ratios/velocities will be calculated after the following formula:

```
r = v = <USER_ESTIMATE> / <ACTUAL_TIME_TO_FINISH>
r = v = 100% : User estimate hit the actual amount of time
r = v = 200% : User estimate too high, finished earlier
r = v = 50% : User estimate too low, finished later
```

I am not very satisfied with the term *velocity*. Velocity is raising expectations such as 

*high/fast = good* and *low/slow = bad*

In terms of estimation velocity behaves like the speed you are riding your bike: Too fast and you will be in danger,too slow and you will be in danger as well. The *best* velocity value is 100% and if you were a perfect estimator you would always hit this value. Therefore I will call the velocity value just **r = ratio* as it is more neutral.

The ratio is a function of different variables:

r = f(`personal-skill`, `task-complexity`, `environment`, [...])

---

`personal-skill`: How good are you estimating tasks? Do you know how long a similar task takes to finish it?

`task-complexity`: Is the objective and scope of the task clear? Are there hidden aspects?

`environment`: Is someone stopping you / helping you finish the task? Can you work without beeing distracted?

---

Note that I did NOT include *personal-effectivity* here. From a ratio you cannot conclude that someone is working inefficiently or slow - the estimate might just have been too optimistic.

The goal of comparing actual time and estimate is to learn something about estimation and improve your `personal-skill` in estimating. In contrast `task-complexity` and `environment` are not in your scope and you may not influence them very much.
Nevertheless they will affect your estimate. Applying the EBS algorithm will take all of these variables into account to deliver an hopefully accurate shipping date for your tasks. 

Question: *How to get ratio pool for a specific contributor?*
Answer: *Find all finished tasks of a contributor: If actual time spent on task and estimate for the task are set calculate the ratio and use value*

### Running Monte-Carlo

If the contributor already finished some tasks you end up with a ratio pool like this (see table below):

pool(contributor) = [`0.10/0.05` `1.50/2.00` `0.25/0.10`] = [`200%` `75%` `250%`]

If you divide the *User time estimate* by those ratios you will get the *Monte-Carlo* time estimates for every unfinished task:

| Task name                        | User time estimate | Kanban list | Total time | Monte-Carlo |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Take bags                        | 0.10               | Done        | 0.05 | N/A             |
| Buy chia seeds                   | 1.50               | Done        | 2.00 |N/A             |
| Buy strawberries                 | 0.25               | Done        | 0.10 | N/A             |
| Buy soy sauce                    | 1.00               | To do | 0.50 |      `0.5h` `1.33h` `0.4h` |
| Have a chat with the store owner | 2.00               | To do | 1.20 | `1.0h` `2.66h` `0.8h`|

In this example one estimate is mapped to three Monte-Carlo time estimates (n=3). We could get more estimates (n=100) if we picked 100 ratios out of the pool. This implies that one ratio would be picked multiple times. If we use a random pick every ratio gets picked 100/3 = 33 times. So our picks will be unbiased.

Below I displayed 100 Monte-Carlo estimates for the task *Have a chat with the store owner*, ordered and highlighted every tenth pick:

From this one can deduce that a task will be finished (see *Time needed (Monte-Carlo)*):

| Propability | Time needed (Monte-Carlo) | Time needed (Remaining-time) |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 10%         | 0,8h        |0h        |
| 20%         | 0,8h        |0h        |
| 30%         | 0,8h        |0h        |
| 40%         | 1,0h        |0h        |
| 50%         | 1,0h        |0h        |
| 60%         | 1,0h        |0h        |
| 70%         | 2,66h       | 1,46h       |
| 80%         | 2,66h       | 1,46h       |
| 90%         | 2,66h       | 1,46h       |
| 100%        | 2,66h       | 1,46h       |

But the user already spent 1.20h on this task.To get an estimate based on the current situation we substract the spent time and floor() it by 0 (see *Time needed (Self-time)*).

This tells us that in 50% of all cases the contributor can finish the task with `0h` additional time. If we want to be more sure we wait `1,46h` longer for her/him finishing the task:

With a bigger ratio pool the propability curve will be more "curvy":

We only focussed on one task and its propability distribution for now. 
But this approach can be applied to the queue of unfinished tasks: Individual task-self-times are just summed up.
