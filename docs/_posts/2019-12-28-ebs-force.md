Now we'll use EBS to estimate how long our shopping tour will take. To run the algorithm just use the `Run EBS` button or hit *CTRL-ALT-M*. The algorithm runs quite a long time for many tasks. So be sure to grap a coffee in the mean time. Results can be seen in a new sheet that is generated. The results are collected per contributor. For the standard contributor *Me* the sheet is called *EbsSheet (Me)*.

 This is what is going to happen internally:

1. Read all the ratios of finished tasks: Fill ratio pool
1. Run Monte-Carlo simulation on queue of unfinished task
1. Plot propability distribution: Get several pairs of (propability\|time) which tell you how certain you are finishing a task with the given amount of time. I will explain plots and curves in a later blog post.

### Fill ratio pool

Ratios/velocities of finished tasks will be calculated after the following formula:

```
r = v = <USER_ESTIMATE> / <ACTUAL_TIME_TO_FINISH>
r = v = 100% : User estimate hit the actual amount of time
r = v = 200% : User estimate too high, finished earlier
r = v = 50% : User estimate too low, finished later
```

I am not very satisfied with the term *velocity*. Velocity is raising expectations such as 

*high/fast = good* and *low/slow = bad*

In terms of estimation velocity behaves like the speed you are riding your bike: Too fast and you will be in danger,too slow and you will be in danger as well. The *best* velocity value is 100% and if you were a perfect estimator you would always hit this value. Therefore I will call the velocity value just **r = ratio* as it is more neutral.

The ratio is a function of different variables:

r = f(`personal-skill`, `task-complexity`, `environment`, [...])

---

`personal-skill`: How good are you estimating tasks? Do you know how long a similar task takes to finish it?

`task-complexity`: Is the objective and scope of the task clear? Are there hidden aspects?

`environment`: Is someone stopping you / helping you finish the task? Can you work without being distracted?

---

Note that I did NOT include *personal-effectivity* here. From a ratio you cannot conclude that someone is working inefficiently or slow - the estimate might just have been too optimistic.

The goal of comparing actual time and estimate is to learn something about estimation and improve your `personal-skill` in estimating. In contrast `task-complexity` and `environment` are not in your scope and you may not influence them very much.
Nevertheless they will affect your velocity/ratio. Applying the EBS algorithm will take all of these variables into account to deliver an hopefully accurate shipping date for your tasks. 

Question: *How to get ratio pool for a specific contributor?*
Answer: *Find all finished tasks of a contributor: If actual time spent on task and estimate for the task are set calculate the ratio and use value*

### Running Monte-Carlo

If the contributor already finished some tasks you end up with a ratio pool like this (see table below):

pool(contributor) = [`0.10/0.05` `1.50/2.00` `0.25/0.10`] = [`200%` `75%` `250%`]

If you divide the *User time estimate* by those ratios you will get the *Monte-Carlo* time estimates for every unfinished task:

| Task name                        | User time estimate | Kanban list | Total time | Monte-Carlo |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Take bags                        | 0.10               | Done        | 0.05 | N/A             |
| Buy chia seeds                   | 1.50               | Done        | 2.00 |N/A             |
| Buy strawberries                 | 0.25               | Done        | 0.10 | N/A             |
| Buy soy sauce                    | 1.00               | To do | 0.50 |      `0.5h` `1.33h` `0.4h` |
| Have a chat with the store owner | 2.00               | To do | 1.20 | `1.0h` `2.66h` `0.8h`|

In this example one estimate is mapped to three Monte-Carlo time estimates (n=3). We could get more estimates (n=100) if we picked 100 ratios out of the pool. This implies that one ratio would be picked multiple times. If we use a random pick every ratio gets picked 100/3 = 33 times. So our picks will be unbiased.

Below 100 Monte-Carlo estimates for the task *Have a chat with the store owner* are shown. I sorted them in ascending order and highlighted every tenth pick:

From this one can deduce that a task will be finished (see *Time needed (Monte-Carlo)*):

| Propability | Time needed (Monte-Carlo) | Time needed (Remaining-time) |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| 10%         | <code--highlight>0.8h</code--highlight>      |0h        |
| 20%         | <code--highlight>0.8h</code--highlight>        |0h        |
| 30%         | <code--highlight>0.8h</code--highlight>        |0h        |
| 40%         | <code--highlight>1.0h</code--highlight>       |0h        |
| 50%         | <code--highlight>1.0h</code--highlight>        |0h        |
| 60%         | <code--highlight>1.0h</code--highlight>        |0h        |
| 70%         | <code--highlight>2.66h</code--highlight>       | 1,46h       |
| 80%         | <code--highlight>2.66h</code--highlight>       | 1,46h       |
| 90%         | <code--highlight>2.66h</code--highlight>       | 1,46h       |
| 100%        | <code--highlight>2.66h</code--highlight>       | 1,46h       |

But the user already spent 1.20h on this task.To get an estimate based on the current situation we substract the spent time and floor() it by 0 (see *Time needed (Self-time)*).

This tells us that in 50% of all cases the contributor can finish the task with `0h` additional time. If we want to be more sure we wait `1,46h` longer for her/him finishing the task:

With a bigger ratio pool the propability curve will be more "curvy":

We only focussed on one task and its propability distribution for now. 
But this approach can be applied to the queue of unfinished tasks: Individual task-self-times are just summed up.
