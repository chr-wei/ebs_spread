### General info
For every task a new row is created in the task list inside the *Planning* sheet.
The column headers of the task list are fixed and should not be renamed as the data is identified by column headers.
In the following examples only relevant columns are shown to visualize the features.

### Add tasks
Let's imagine you want to plan a shopping trip and need to buy some items from the market. Your initial list looks like this:

| Task no. | Task name                        | Kanban list | Priority | tHash              |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| #000002  | Buy chia seeds                   | To do       | 3        | t50344759B92C4C0A3 |
| #000001  | Take bags                        | To do       | 2        | t5C33AE2C601539DCA |
| #000003  | Have a chat with the store owner | To do       | 1        | t35EBA085FF3A95514 |

Add a task by using the button *Add task* or hit the shortcut

`CTRL+ALT+N` (N for new)

The list will then look like this:

| Task no. | Task name                        | Kanban list | Priority | tHash              |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| **#000004**  | **\<ENTER_NAME\>**           | **To do**   | **4**    | **tBA7FC881E2CA8611F** |
| #000002  | Buy chia seeds                   | To do       | 3        | t50344759B92C4C0A3 |
| #000001  | Take bags                        | To do       | 2        | t5C33AE2C601539DCA |
| #000003  | Have a chat with the store owner | To do       | 1        | t35EBA085FF3A95514 |
