Tracking time for tasks is one thing. Another quite common thing in managing projects is declaring some kind of state in which a task is in. For example: `To do` `In progress` `Testing` `Stuck` `Done`.

Methods like Kanban or Scrum recommend this to help teams getting organized and sharing information between each other. I focussed on the Kanban approach but regarding  to task states the methods only differ in state labels.

### Mimic Kanban board

Tools like Trello, Github or Gitlab use visual boards combined with drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks to different states. With Excel you cannot display tasks in board-like manner easily. Therefore the a task's state is selected from a dropdown menu in the column **Kanban list**: 
`To do`: This state / label is applied when the task is created. It means that the task has not been started yet but is on your list of work items

`In progress`: This state can be set if you have started working on the task and it is not completed yet. The state will 

`Done`
