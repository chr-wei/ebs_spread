After adding all tasks you should prioritize and order them to decide what to do first.
Every tasks has a unique priority value - there are no tasks with the same priority.
This determines the task queue for all applied algorithms and time and date calculation.

### Prioritizing tasks

Tags that were also mentioned in the last post become useful if tasks have to be reordered or sorted. A selected task can be 

shifted up by hitting *CTRL-ALT-+* 

and shifted down by hitting *CTRL-ALT--*

Shifting up- or downwards means adjusting the priority of the task. If a tag is selected and multiple tasks are highlighted all highlighted tasks will be shifted accordingly. Shifting down the selected tag `Food products` ...

| Task no. | Task name                        | %Tag 1 | %Tag 2      | %Tag 3    |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **#000004**  | **Buy chia seeds**           | **Food products**  | | **Important** |
| **#000003**  | **Buy strawberries**         | **`Food products`**  |  |           |
| #000002  | Take bags                        |        | Preparation |           |
| #000001  | Have a chat with the store owner |        |             | Important |

... becomes ...

| Task no. | Task name                        | %Tag 1 | %Tag 2      | %Tag 3    |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| #000002  | Take bags                        |        | Preparation |           |
| **#000004**  | **Buy chia seeds**           | **Food products**  | | **Important** |
| **#000003**  | **Buy strawberries**         | **`Food products`**  |  |           |

As all selected tasks move together it can be painful to reorder them, so that they stick together.

Use the *Gather*  feature *CTRL+ALT+G* 

to make selected tasks form a block of tasks:

| Task no. | Task name                        | %Tag 1 | %Tag 2      | %Tag 3    |

| **#000004**  | **Buy chia seeds**           | **Food products**  | | **`Important`** |
| #000003  | Buy strawberries      | Food products  |  |           |
| **#000001**  | **Have a chat with the store owner** |        |             | **Important** |

Not only tags can be customized but also the tag column names. Make sure a tag column starts with *%Tag*.
Then the three tag columns could also be named like *%Tag feature*, *%Tag product* and *%Tag project* to give your tags a rough structure. You can even add more tag columns or remove them if you like.
