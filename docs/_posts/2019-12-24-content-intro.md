Find more basic info on evidence based sheduling (EBS) approach by Joel Spolsky by visiting his <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/">blog</a>.

## Features needed for EBS

1. Collecting and queuing tasks, prioritizing and sorting them (Kanban boards become handy here)
2. Time tracking to build up a database of time needed to finish tasks (per user)
3. Running EBS 'statistics' on the collected data. The statistics methods used are not too complex, so I am not confident enough to call it statistics without the hyphens
4. And not to forget: Easy access to the tool in your daily working life and options to customize the tool. This especially made me choose Excel and VBA as a platform.
Nearly everybody owns a license and installation or setting up an development environment is not necessary.
5. This is open source software. Use it, change it, port it to a super-duper website with cute interface. But please give a tiny hint from where you got it. Thank you! 

Now lets dig deeper into the content of EBS and the implementation inside the spreadsheet:
